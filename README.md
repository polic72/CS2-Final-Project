# CS2-Final-Project
As the title says, this was my CS2 final project. It's a simple (yet terrible) game very slightly inspired by the Legend of Zelda. It entirely runs off of the JavaFX library, and it is needed to play.

The main method is in the "Computer Science Final Post Presentation/src/com/theberge_stonis/game/Game.java" class.

Credit to Connor Theberge for being my partner on the endeavor. He did a lot of the textures, animations, and general class-coding for the project.
